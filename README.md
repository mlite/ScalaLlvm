ScalaLlvm -- Scala implementation of LLVM
=========


This repo is created for hosting my first effort of implementing LLVM
in Scala. The project was late abandoned in favor of Haskell
implementation. 


Hoopl is always the library I want to use. So I first started to port
Hoopl to Scala in June, 2011.
