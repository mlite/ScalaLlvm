ScalaLlvm -- Scala implementation of LLVM
=========

This repo is created for hosting my first effort of implementing LLVM
in a type safe language -- Scala. The project was late abandoned in
favor of Haskell implementation (HsLlvm).

Hoopl is always the library I want to use. So I first started to port
Hoopl to Scala in June, 2011. It turned out the porting is not so trivial, and I'm 
still not sure the porting is correct. I release it so some code can 
be used to as examples for studying how to write parser and data flow analysis in Scala.
