/*  Note [TxFactBase invariants]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The TxFactBase is used only during a fixpoint iteration (or "sweep"),
and accumulates facts (and the transformed code) during the fixpoint
iteration.

* tfb_fbase increases monotonically, across all sweeps

* At the beginning of each sweep
      tfb_cha  = NoChange
      tfb_lbls = {}

* During each sweep we process each block in turn.  Processing a block
  is done thus:
    1.  Read from tfb_fbase the facts for its entry label (forward)
        or successors labels (backward)
    2.  Transform those facts into new facts for its successors (forward)
        or entry label (backward)
    3.  Augment tfb_fbase with that info
  We call the labels read in step (1) the "in-labels" of the sweep

* The field tfb_lbls is the set of in-labels of all blocks that have
  been processed so far this sweep, including the block that is
  currently being processed.  tfb_lbls is initialised to {}.  It is a
  subset of the Labels of the *original* (not transformed) blocks.

* The tfb_cha field is set to SomeChange iff we decide we need to
  perform another iteration of the fixpoint loop. It is initialsed to NoChange.

  Specifically, we set tfb_cha to SomeChange in step (3) iff
    (a) The fact in tfb_fbase for a block L changes
    (b) L is in tfb_lbls
  Reason: until a label enters the in-labels its accumuated fact in tfb_fbase
  has not been read, hence cannot affect the outcome

Note [Unreachable blocks]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
A block that is not in the domain of tfb_fbase is "currently unreachable".
A currently-unreachable block is not even analyzed.  Reason: consider
constant prop and this graph, with entry point L1:
  L1: x:=3; goto L4
  L2: x:=4; goto L4
  L4: if x>3 goto L2 else goto L5
Here L2 is actually unreachable, but if we process it with bottom input fact,
we'll propagate (x=4) to L4, and nuke the otherwise-good rewriting of L4.

* If a currently-unreachable block is not analyzed, then its rewritten
  graph will not be accumulated in tfb_rg.  And that is good:
  unreachable blocks simply do not appear in the output.

* Note that clients must be careful to provide a fact (even if bottom)
  for each entry point. Otherwise useful blocks may be garbage collected.

* Note that updateFact must set the change-flag if a label goes from
  not-in-fbase to in-fbase, even if its fact is bottom.  In effect the
  real fact lattice is
       UNR
       bottom
       the points above bottom

* Even if the fact is going from UNR to bottom, we still call the
  client's fact_join function because it might give the client
  some useful debugging information.

* All of this only applies for *forward* fixpoints.  For the backward
  case we must treat every block as reachable; it might finish with a
  'return', and therefore have no successors, for example.
